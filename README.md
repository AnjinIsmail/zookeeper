# Zookeeper
## Descrtiption 
Here's the scenario: the local zoo has received funding to build a new online catalog, and they've asked us to create a web server for a front-end application they’re developing, called Zoo Keepr. This site’s data will be stored on the server we create. This will allow animal enthusiasts to access the data from different locations and browsers without needing to download it to their device.
Decided to use Heroku for our server. The overall steps for the user to interact with the site.
### Create a web Server
- User can request for a list of all animal data
- User can request data for just one animal based on its id value
- User is able to do this from anywhere and not just my computer
### Allow user creation of data
- User is able to add a new animal to the catalog
### Implement a front end
- User is able to view data from the server in a front-end web application
- User can create new data by submitting an HTML form
### Incorporate a separate dataset
- User is able to access and create different types of data stored on the server
